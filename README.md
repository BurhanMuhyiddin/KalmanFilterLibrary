# Kalman Filter Library

Hi. This is my attempt to create Kalman Filter library in C++ with OOP. This library will include Linear Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter. I will document the whole code. I also think to create a course on Kalman Filter where I will explin in more detailed way how this libarary has been developed. Additionally, it will contain several examples for each filter to show the credibility of the code. Thanks.
